# Rock-paper-scissors-GUI
GUI version of the rock, paper, scissors game

Since making the rock, paper, scissors game I decided I wanted to learn how to make a GUI so it was more user-friendly.
A couple of friends also tackled the rock, paper, scissors game; coming up with their own implementation. It's a fun thing to work on and interesting to see the different ways people approach it. One of those was what also made me look into enums - I'd heard about them before but had never worked with them and that too was interesting to learn about (thanks Alex).

If you try this out and have any problems using it, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
